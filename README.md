## Prerequisites

`ipvs` module is required by the vip manager.

Make sure that the ip_vs module is loaded.

```
# lsmod| grep ^ip_vs
```

If no `ip_vs` module is loaded, install `ipvsadm` 

```console
# yum -y install ipvsadm

# ipvsadm -ln
IP Virtual Server version 1.2.1 (size=4096)
Prot LocalAddress:Port Scheduler Flags
  -> RemoteAddress:Port           Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn

# lsmod | grep ^ip_vs
ip_vs                 145497  0
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release --namespace my-namespace chart/keepalived
```

Another example: To use few IP address from the available subnet 

```console
echo Use subnet mask 29 to reserve 6 hosts in 192.168.142.248/29 Class C network.
echo keepalivedCloudProvider.serviceIPRange="192.168.142.248/29"

helm install . --name keepalived --namespace istio-system \
 --set keepalivedCloudProvider.serviceIPRange="192.168.142.248/29"
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes resources associated with the chart and deletes the release.
